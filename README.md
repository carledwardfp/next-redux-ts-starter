## Help

The current version adds extraReducers to every reducer file. If you know a way to make it global in `store.ts`, please add a Pull Request.

```tsx
// hydrateAction.ts
import { createAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { HYDRATE } from 'next-redux-wrapper';

const hydrateAction = createAction<any>(HYDRATE);

export default hydrateAction;

// reducer
{
  ...
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(hydrateAction, (_state, action) => {
      return action.payload.counter;
    });
  },
}
```
